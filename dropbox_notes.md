## How to embed a video from your Dropbox account on a website

You can, depending on the platform you're referring to. 
You'll need to create a shared link to the video, then modify the link 
by changing the **?dl=0** at the end to **?raw=1**. 
That results in a direct link to the file which you can use to embed it on most sites.

Just remember that when embedding a file like that 
(or really, anytime a file is played directly from Dropbox) 
there are bandwidth limitations to consider. Depending on the 
size of the file and your account type, you could easily use up 
all of alotted bandwidth for your account.
